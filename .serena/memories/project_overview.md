# Project Overview

## Purpose

This is a comprehensive **Azure Service Operator (ASO) demonstration repository** for platform engineering and multi-cloud infrastructure management. The project demonstrates how to manage cloud infrastructure through Kubernetes using Infrastructure as Code principles.

## Core Mission

- Showcase ASO capabilities for managing Azure resources via Kubernetes CRDs
- Provide multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kind)
- Implement platform engineering patterns with namespace-as-a-service functionality
- Demonstrate GitOps workflows with Flux and Istio service mesh integration

## Key Features

- **Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning** through Kubernetes
- **Platform engineering APIs** for self-service namespace creation
- **Service mesh integration** with Istio for traffic management and security
- **Monitoring and observability** with comprehensive metrics collection
- **Security hardening** with network policies and identity management
- **Disaster recovery** and backup strategies

## Technology Stack Overview

- **Infrastructure**: Azure Service Operator, Crossplane, Kubernetes
- **Orchestration**: Flux GitOps, Helm charts, Kustomize
- **Service Mesh**: Istio with mTLS and traffic policies
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js, Kubernetes client
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Scripting**: Nushell for automation and workflows
- **Environment**: Devbox for consistent development environments
