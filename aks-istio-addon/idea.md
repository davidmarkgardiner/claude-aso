# Istio Traffic Management Agents Team Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a team of specialized cloud agents designed to deploy, understand, and test Istio traffic management components on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with the Istio add-on. The team will focus on the five core traffic management CRDs in shared cluster scenarios with namespace-based tenancy.

## Core Components Overview

Based on the official Istio documentation, the five key traffic management Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are:

1. **Virtual Services** - Define traffic routing rules and match conditions
2. **Destination Rules** - Configure traffic policies and service subsets  
3. **Gateways** - Manage ingress/egress traffic at mesh edge
4. **Service Entries** - Add external services to mesh registry
5. **Sidecars** - Configure proxy behavior and limit configuration scope

## Agent Team Structure

### Agent 1: Discovery & Research Agent
**Primary Role**: Web research and API understanding

**Responsibilities**:
- Search for latest Istio traffic management documentation and best practices
- Research AKS Istio add-on specific limitations and capabilities
- Analyze multi-tenancy patterns and namespace isolation strategies
- Document current CRD schemas and supported configurations
- Identify AKS-specific constraints vs native Istio installations

**Key Research Areas**:
- Current Istio API versions and schema changes
- AKS add-on supported vs blocked configurations (per your AKS doc)
- Multi-tenant deployment patterns for shared clusters
- Namespace-based isolation best practices

### Agent 2: Cluster Analysis Agent  
**Primary Role**: Kubernetes cluster introspection and CRD discovery

**Responsibilities**:
- Examine existing CRDs installed on the AKS cluster
- Analyze available Istio controller configurations
- Map namespace permissions and RBAC policies
- Document what's available per namespace scope
- Identify shared vs tenant-specific resources

**Key Analysis Tasks**:
```bash
# Example discovery commands this agent would run
kubectl get crd | grep istio
kubectl api-resources --api-group=networking.istio.io
kubectl get istio-operator -n aks-istio-system
kubectl get configmap istio-shared-configmap-* -n aks-istio-system
```

**Expected Findings**:
- Available CRD versions and capabilities
- Namespace-scoped vs cluster-scoped resources
- Controller configurations and supported features
- Multi-tenancy boundaries and restrictions

### Agent 3: Deployment Orchestrator Agent
**Primary Role**: Deploy and configure traffic management components

**Responsibilities**:
- Create namespace-specific configurations for each component
- Deploy test scenarios across different tenant namespaces
- Implement various traffic routing patterns
- Configure cross-namespace communication where appropriate
- Test isolation boundaries between tenants

**Deployment Scenarios**:
- **Basic Traffic Routing**: Simple Virtual Service â†’ Destination Rule pairs
- **Cross-Namespace Communication**: Service mesh connectivity patterns
- **Gateway Configurations**: Both ingress and internal gateway setups
- **Service Entry Examples**: External service integration
- **Sidecar Configurations**: Namespace isolation and performance optimization

### Agent 4: Testing & Validation Agent
**Primary Role**: Functional testing and behavior validation

**Responsibilities**:
- Execute comprehensive test suites for each component
- Validate traffic routing and policy enforcement
- Test multi-tenant isolation boundaries
- Performance testing under different configurations
- Security boundary validation

**Test Categories**:

#### Functional Tests
- Traffic routing accuracy
- Load balancing behavior
- Circuit breaker functionality  
- Retry and timeout mechanisms
- Fault injection capabilities

#### Multi-Tenancy Tests
- Namespace isolation verification
- Cross-tenant communication blocking
- Resource quota enforcement
- Configuration scope validation

#### Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- End-to-end traffic flow validation
- Gateway to service routing
- External service connectivity

### Agent 5: Documentation & Reporting Agent
**Primary Role**: Knowledge synthesis and documentation

**Responsibilities**:
- Compile findings from all other agents
- Create comprehensive deployment guides
- Document best practices and gotchas
- Generate test reports and recommendations
- Maintain configuration templates

## Multi-Tenancy Considerations for Shared AKS Clusters

### Namespace-Based Tenancy Model
Based on research, the recommended approach for shared AKS clusters:

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**:
- Each tenant gets dedicated namespace(s)
- Sidecar configurations limit cross-namespace communication
- RBAC policies restrict resource access
- Network policies provide additional security boundaries

**Key Configuration Pattern**:
```yaml
# Per-tenant Sidecar configuration to limit scope
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: Sidecar
metadata:
  name: tenant-isolation
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  egress:
  - hosts:
    - "./tenant-a/*"        # Only services in same namespace
    - "istio-system/*"      # Istio control plane
    - "shared-services/*"   # Common services namespace
```

### AKS Add-on Specific Considerations

**Supported Configurations** (from your AKS documentation):
- MeshConfig customization via istio-shared-configmap-<revision>
- Limited extension provider support
- Specific field restrictions (allowed/supported/blocked)

**Key Limitations**:
- Some CRDs blocked (ProxyConfig, WorkloadEntry, WorkloadGroup)
- Limited EnvoyFilter support
- No multi-cluster deployments yet
- Windows containers not supported

## Agent Coordination Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery (Agents 1 & 2)
1. Research Agent searches latest documentation and patterns
2. Analysis Agent examines cluster state and available resources
3. Both agents collaborate to document current capabilities

### Phase 2: Planning (All Agents)
1. Orchestrator Agent creates deployment plans based on findings
2. Testing Agent designs test scenarios
3. Documentation Agent prepares templates and guides

### Phase 3: Execution (Agents 3 & 4)
1. Orchestrator deploys configurations across test namespaces
2. Testing Agent validates functionality and isolation
3. Both report results to Documentation Agent

### Phase 4: Documentation (Agent 5)
1. Compile comprehensive findings
2. Create deployment guides and best practices
3. Document discovered limitations and workarounds

## Expected Deliverables

### Component-Specific Guides
- Virtual Services deployment patterns and testing procedures
- Destination Rules configuration options and load balancing testing
- Gateway setup for both ingress and internal routing
- Service Entry patterns for external service integration  
- Sidecar optimization for multi-tenant environments

### Multi-Tenancy Documentation
- Namespace isolation strategies and validation procedures
- Cross-tenant communication patterns (when needed)
- RBAC and network policy integration
- Performance considerations for shared clusters

### Test Reports
- Functional test results for each component
- Multi-tenancy isolation validation
- Performance benchmarks under various configurations
- Security boundary test results

### Operational Guides
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Configuration management best practices
- Upgrade and maintenance procedures

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: All 5 traffic management CRDs tested and documented
2. **Isolation**: Multi-tenant boundaries properly validated  
3. **Functionality**: Core features working as expected
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for team adoption
5. **Automation**: Repeatable deployment and testing procedures

## Next Steps

1. Set up the agent team with appropriate cluster access
2. Begin with Discovery and Analysis agents (Phase 1)
3. Use findings to inform deployment strategy
4. Execute comprehensive testing across all components
5. Document lessons learned and best practices

This structured approach ensures thorough understanding of Istio traffic management capabilities within AKS add-on constraints, with particular attention to multi-tenant shared cluster scenarios.
