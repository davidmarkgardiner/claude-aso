# Claude Code Implementation Plan: Agent Team Cluster Setup

## Overview

This plan provides a comprehensive approach to setting up the enterprise Istio agent team with appropriate cluster access using Claude Code for automation. Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that can automate deployment tasks, handle git workflows, and execute routine infrastructure tasks through natural language commands.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Prerequisites

### Minikube Development Environment Setup

**Claude Code Task 1: Minikube Environment Bootstrap**

```markdown
# Claude Code Command

Please set up a complete Minikube development environment for Istio service mesh testing with the following requirements:

1. Install/verify Minikube with adequate resources (8GB RAM, 4 CPUs)
2. Enable necessary addons: ingress, dns, storage-provisioner
3. Install Cert-Manager using Helm
4. Install Azure Service Operator
5. Install External-DNS with Azure DNS provider configuration
6. Create base directory structure for our Istio agent project
7. Set up kubectl context and verify cluster connectivity

Use these environment variables:

- AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=133d5755-4074-4d6e-ad38-eb2a6ad12903
- DNS_ZONE=davidmarkgardiner.co.uk
- DNS_RESOURCE_GROUP=dns
```

**Expected Deliverables**:

- Fully configured Minikube environment
- Cert-Manager deployment with CRDs
- Azure Service Operator installation
- External-DNS configured for Azure DNS
- Project directory structure with CLAUDE.md setup

### AKS Production Environment Setup

**Claude Code Task 2: AKS Cluster with Istio Add-on**

```markdown
# Claude Code Command

Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with Istio add-on enabled for our enterprise agent team project:

1. Create resource group for AKS cluster
2. Deploy AKS cluster with Istio add-on using Azure CLI
3. Configure cluster with appropriate node pools and sizing
4. Enable Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization
5. Set up Azure DNS integration
6. Install Cert-Manager for certificate automation
7. Verify Istio control plane components are running
8. Create kubeconfig contexts for different agent roles

Requirements:

- Cluster name: istio-agents-cluster
- Location: East US 2
- Node count: 3 (Standard_D4s_v3)
- Istio add-on enabled
- Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization
- Container Insights enabled
```

**Expected Deliverables**:

- Proper DNS and certificate management
- Monitoring and logging configured
- Multiple kubeconfig contexts prepared

## Phase 2: Agent Identity and Access Management

### Service Account Architecture

**Claude Code Task 3: Multi-Agent RBAC Setup**

```markdown
# Claude Code Command

   - Full access to deploy Istio CRDs across all namespaces
   - Create/modify: VirtualService, DestinationRule, Gateway, ServiceEntry, Sidecar, AuthorizationPolicy
   - Namespace creation and management permissions
   - ConfigMap and Secret management for certificates

2. **Test Engineer Agent**:
   - Read-only access to all Istio resources
   - Execute permissions for test pods
   - Access to logs and metrics
   - Limited kubectl exec permissions for debugging

3. **SRE Agent**:
   - Broad diagnostic permissions across cluster
   - Pod logs, events, and resource status access
   - Debug tools and troubleshooting commands
   - Proxy configuration inspection via istioctl

4. **Documentation Engineer Agent**:
   - Read access to all configurations and resources

- tenant-b (development workloads)
- shared-services (common infrastructure)
- testing (chaos and validation)

Generate kubeconfig files for each agent with appropriate contexts.
```

**Expected Deliverables**:
