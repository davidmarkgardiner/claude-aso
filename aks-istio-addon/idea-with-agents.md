        - destination:
            host: web-app.tenant-a.svc.cluster.local
            subset: v2
          weight: 10 # 10% to canary version
```

#### Demo 3: A/B Testing with Header-Based Routing

```yaml
# Scenario: Route beta users to new version
# Business Value: Feature testing with specific user groups

apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ab-testing
spec:
  hosts:
    - app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk
  gateways:
    - main-gateway
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            x-user-type:
              exact: beta
      route:
        - destination:
            host: web-app.tenant-a.svc.cluster.local
            subset: v2
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: web-app.tenant-a.svc.cluster.local
            subset: v1
```

- Operational efficiency improvements
- Scalability and multi-tenancy advantages

## Multi-Tenancy Considerations for Shared AKS Clusters

### Namespace-Based Tenancy Model

Based on research, the recommended approach for shared AKS clusters:

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**:

- Each tenant gets dedicated namespace(s)
- Sidecar configurations limit cross-namespace communication
- RBAC policies restrict resource access
- Network policies provide additional security boundaries

**Key Configuration Pattern**:

```yaml
# Per-tenant Sidecar configuration to limit scope
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: Sidecar
metadata:
  name: tenant-isolation
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  egress:
    - hosts:
        - "./tenant-a/*" # Only services in same namespace
        - "istio-system/*" # Istio control plane
        - "shared-services/*" # Common services namespace
```

### AKS Add-on Specific Considerations

**Supported Configurations** (from your AKS documentation):

- MeshConfig customization via istio-shared-configmap-<revision>
- Limited extension provider support
- Specific field restrictions (allowed/supported/blocked)

**Key Limitations**:

- Some CRDs blocked (ProxyConfig, WorkloadEntry, WorkloadGroup)
- Limited EnvoyFilter support
- No multi-cluster deployments yet
- Windows containers not supported

## Agent Coordination Workflow

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Agent 1 & 2)

1. **DNS & Certificates** (Agent 1):
   - Deploy External-DNS with Azure DNS integration
   - Configure Cert-Manager for automated certificate provisioning
   - Test DNS propagation and certificate issuance

2. **Application Baseline** (Agent 2):
   - Deploy test applications in multiple namespaces (tenant-a, tenant-b)
   - Establish baseline connectivity without Istio
   - Validate health checks and monitoring endpoints

**Success Criteria**: Applications accessible via LoadBalancer/NodePort, certificates issued, DNS records created

### Phase 2: Istio Integration (Agent 3)

1. **Gateway Configuration**:
   - Deploy Istio Gateway for HTTPS ingress
   - Configure VirtualServices for traffic routing
   - Integrate with existing DNS and certificate infrastructure

2. **Traffic Routing Setup**:
   - Implement host-based routing for multi-tenancy
   - Configure path-based routing within tenants
   - Set up header-based routing for advanced scenarios

**Success Criteria**: External traffic flowing through Istio Gateway to backend pods

### Phase 3: Validation & Chaos Testing (Agent 4)

1. **Functional Testing**:

   ```bash
   # Real-world validation commands
   curl -v https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/health
   curl -H "X-User-Type: beta" https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version
   ```

2. **Resilience Testing**:
   - Pod failure scenarios
   - Gateway restart scenarios
   - Certificate renewal validation
   - DNS propagation testing

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Load testing with multiple concurrent requests
   - Latency measurement through Istio proxy
   - Resource utilization monitoring

**Success Criteria**: All test scenarios pass, system remains stable under failure conditions

### Phase 4: Business Demonstration (Agent 5)

1. **Demo Preparation**:
   - Create scripted business scenarios
   - Prepare before/after comparisons
   - Document configuration changes and their business impact

2. **Documentation Creation**:
   - Working YAML configurations with annotations
   - Step-by-step deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting runbooks

**Success Criteria**: Business-ready demonstrations showing clear value proposition

## Expected Deliverables

### Working YAML Configurations

**Gateway & VirtualService Templates**:

```yaml
# Production-ready Istio Gateway configuration
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: production-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: "app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk,app2.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk"
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 443
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE
        credentialName: davidmarkgardiner-wildcard-cert
      hosts:
        - "*.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk"
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "*.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk"
      redirect:
        httpsRedirect: true
```

### Test Validation Scripts

**Automated Test Suite**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# comprehensive-ingress-test.sh

set -e

BASE_DOMAIN="davidmarkgardiner.co.uk"
APPS=("app1" "app2")

echo "üöÄ Starting Istio Ingress Validation"

for app in "${APPS[@]}"; do
    URL="https://${app}.${BASE_DOMAIN}"

    echo "Testing ${URL}..."

    # Test 1: HTTPS connectivity
    if curl -f -s "${URL}/health" > /dev/null; then
        echo "‚úÖ ${app}: HTTPS connectivity working"
    else
        echo "‚ùå ${app}: HTTPS connectivity failed"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Test 2: Certificate validation
    if curl -s --connect-timeout 5 "${URL}" | grep -q "200 OK"; then
        echo "‚úÖ ${app}: TLS certificate valid"
    else
        echo "‚ùå ${app}: TLS certificate issues"
    fi

    # Test 3: Load balancing
    echo "Testing load balancing for ${app}..."
    UNIQUE_PODS=$(for i in {1..10}; do
        curl -s "${URL}/pod-info" | grep "Pod:" | cut -d: -f2
    done | sort -u | wc -l)

    if [ "$UNIQUE_PODS" -gt 1 ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ ${app}: Load balancing working (${UNIQUE_PODS} unique pods)"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  ${app}: Only 1 pod responding (may be expected)"
    fi
done

echo "üéâ All ingress tests completed successfully"
```

### Business Demonstration Scripts

**Demo Scenarios with curl Commands**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# business-demo.sh - Live demonstration script

echo "=== BUSINESS DEMONSTRATION: Istio Traffic Management ==="

echo "üìä Scenario 1: Blue-Green Deployment"
echo "Current version check:"
curl -s https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version | jq '.version'

echo "Switching to version 2..."
kubectl apply -f virtualservice-v2.yaml

echo "New version check:"
curl -s https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version | jq '.version'
echo "‚úÖ Zero-downtime deployment completed"

echo ""
echo "üìä Scenario 2: Canary Deployment (10% traffic to v2)"
kubectl apply -f virtualservice-canary.yaml

echo "Testing traffic distribution (20 requests):"
for i in {1..20}; do
    VERSION=$(curl -s https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version | jq -r '.version')
    echo "Request $i: Version $VERSION"
done

echo ""
echo "üìä Scenario 3: A/B Testing with Beta Users"
echo "Normal user (gets v1):"
curl -s https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version | jq '.version'

echo "Beta user (gets v2):"
curl -H "X-User-Type: beta" -s https://app1.davidmarkgardiner.co.uk/version | jq '.version'

echo "üéØ Business Value Demonstrated:"
echo "  - Zero-downtime deployments"
echo "  - Risk-free rollouts with canary testing"
echo "  - Feature testing with specific user groups"
echo "  - Automated certificate management"
echo "  - Multi-tenant isolation"
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: All 5 traffic management CRDs tested and documented
2. **Isolation**: Multi-tenant boundaries properly validated
3. **Functionality**: Core features working as expected
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for team adoption
5. **Automation**: Repeatable deployment and testing procedures

## Next Steps

1. Set up the agent team with appropriate cluster access
2. Begin with Discovery and Analysis agents (Phase 1)
3. Use findings to inform deployment strategy
4. Execute comprehensive testing across all components
5. Document lessons learned and best practices

This structured approach ensures thorough understanding of Istio traffic management capabilities within AKS add-on constraints, with particular attention to multi-tenant shared cluster scenarios.
