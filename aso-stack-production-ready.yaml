# Production-Ready ASO Stack - Missing Components Analysis
# This file documents the gaps found in the current ASO deployment

apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  # ========== EXISTING RESOURCES (Well Configured) ==========
  - resourcegroup.yaml # ✅ Base resource group
  - identity.yaml # ✅ Workload identities
  - roleassignment.yaml # ✅ DNS permissions
  - cluster.yaml # ✅ AKS cluster (comprehensive config)
  - federated.yaml # ✅ Federated credentials
  - extension.yaml # ✅ Flux extension
  - fluxconfiguration.yaml # ✅ GitOps configuration
  - dns.yaml # ✅ Public DNS zone

  # ========== MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS ==========

  # 1. SECURITY & GOVERNANCE
  - keyvault.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Azure Key Vault for secrets
  - policyassignment.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Azure Policy enforcement
  - networksecuritygroup.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Network security rules
  - useraccessadministrator.yaml # ❌ MISSING: RBAC role assignments

  # 2. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
  - loganalyticsworkspace.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Centralized logging
  - applicationinsights.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Application monitoring
  - diagnosticsettings.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Resource diagnostics
  - actiongroup.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Alert notifications
  - metricalert.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Custom alerts

  # 3. STORAGE & DATA SERVICES
  - storageaccount.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Persistent storage
  - containerregistry.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Private container images
  - postgresqlserver.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Database services
  - cosmosdbaccount.yaml # ❌ MISSING: NoSQL database option

  # 4. NETWORKING ENHANCEMENTS
  - virtualnetwork.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Dedicated VNet
  - publicip.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Static public IPs
  - applicationgateway.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Application Gateway Ingress
  - loadbalancer.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Load balancer configuration
  - privateendpoint.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Private connectivity

  # 5. BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY
  - recoveryvault.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Backup services
  - backuppolicy.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Backup policies
  - sitereplication.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Multi-region setup

  # 6. COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE
  - managementgroup.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Resource organization
  - blueprint.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Governance templates
  - costanalysis.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Cost management
  - resourcelock.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Resource protection

  # 7. ADVANCED SECURITY
  - sentinel.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Security monitoring
  - securitycenter.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Security recommendations
  - keyvaultcertificate.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Certificate management
  - privatednszones.yaml # ❌ MISSING: Private DNS resolution

# ========== CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT ==========

# STRENGTHS:
# ✅ Excellent AKS cluster configuration with security features
# ✅ Proper workload identity implementation
# ✅ GitOps integration with Flux
# ✅ External DNS automation
# ✅ Service mesh (Istio) integration
# ✅ Comprehensive cluster security settings

# CRITICAL GAPS:
# ❌ No centralized secrets management (Key Vault)
# ❌ Missing monitoring and observability stack
# ❌ No persistent storage provisioning
# ❌ Lack of backup and disaster recovery
# ❌ No network security enforcement
# ❌ Missing compliance and governance controls
# ❌ No database services provisioned
# ❌ Limited security monitoring capabilities

# PRODUCTION READINESS SCORE: 6/10
# Current setup is good for development/testing but needs enhancement for production

# ========== RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS ==========
# 1. Implement Key Vault for secrets management
# 2. Add Log Analytics and Application Insights
# 3. Configure backup and disaster recovery
# 4. Implement network security controls
# 5. Add database services (PostgreSQL/CosmosDB)
# 6. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
# 7. Implement compliance and governance policies
# 8. Add private networking components
