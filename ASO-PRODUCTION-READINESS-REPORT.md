# Azure Service Operator (ASO) Production Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary

**Current Production Readiness Score: 6.5/10**

Your ASO stack demonstrates strong foundational infrastructure with excellent AKS cluster configuration, workload identity implementation, and GitOps integration. However, several critical enterprise-grade components are missing for production deployment.

## Current Stack Analysis ✅

- **Site Recovery**: No disaster recovery
- **Multi-Region Setup**: Single point of failure

**Impact**:
- No data protection
- No disaster recovery plan
- Potential business continuity issues
- Risk of complete data loss

**Risk Level**: HIGH 🔴

## Production-Ready Enhancement Plan

   - Configure Application Insights
   - Set up critical alerts and notifications

3. **Network Security** ⚡ IMMEDIATE
   - Deploy Network Security Groups
   - Configure proper firewall rules
   - Implement network segmentation

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Hardening (Week 3-4)
1. **Storage Solutions**
   - Deploy secure Storage Account
   - Implement private Container Registry
   - Configure proper access controls

2. **Database Services**
   - Deploy PostgreSQL Flexible Server
   - Configure private connectivity
   - Implement backup policies

3. **Enhanced Networking**
   - Deploy dedicated Virtual Network
   - Configure Application Gateway with WAF
   - Implement private DNS zones

### Phase 3: Business Continuity (Week 5-6)
1. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Deploy Recovery Services Vault
   - Configure automated backup policies
   - Test recovery procedures

2. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Set up secondary region infrastructure
   - Configure site recovery
   - Document DR procedures

3. **Compliance & Governance**
   - Implement Azure Policy assignments
   - Configure compliance monitoring
   - Set up resource locks

## Implementation Resources

The following ASO resource templates have been created:

1. **`missing-keyvault.yaml`** - Azure Key Vault with proper RBAC
2. **`missing-monitoring.yaml`** - Complete observability stack
3. **`missing-storage.yaml`** - Storage Account and Container Registry
4. **`missing-networking.yaml`** - VNet, NSG, and Application Gateway
5. **`missing-database.yaml`** - PostgreSQL and CosmosDB services
6. **`missing-backup-recovery.yaml`** - Backup and disaster recovery

## Cost Considerations

**Estimated Monthly Costs (UK South):**
- Key Vault: £5-15/month
- Log Analytics: £50-200/month (depending on ingestion)
- Application Insights: £20-100/month
- Storage Account: £10-50/month
- Container Registry: £15-50/month
- PostgreSQL: £100-500/month
- Application Gateway: £150-300/month
- Recovery Vault: £50-200/month

**Total Estimated: £400-1,415/month** (varies by usage)

## Security Recommendations

1. **Enable Private Endpoints** for all Azure services
2. **Configure Network Security Groups** with restrictive rules
3. **Implement Azure Policy** for compliance enforcement
4. **Enable Advanced Threat Protection** on all services
5. **Configure Diagnostic Settings** for all resources
6. **Use Managed Identities** exclusively (no service principals)
7. **Enable Key Vault Integration** for all secrets
8. **Configure Backup Policies** for all stateful services

## Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts
- AKS cluster health and node status
- High CPU/memory usage (>80%)
- Pod restart failures
- Storage capacity warnings
- Network connectivity issues
- Security policy violations

### Observability Stack
- **Logs**: Centralized in Log Analytics
- **Metrics**: Azure Monitor + Prometheus
- **Traces**: Application Insights integration
- **Dashboards**: Azure Monitor workbooks
- **Alerts**: Action Groups with multiple channels

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the missing component implementations
2. **Deploy Phase 1 components** (Key Vault, monitoring, networking security)
3. **Migrate existing secrets** to Key Vault
4. **Test monitoring and alerting** functionality
5. **Proceed with Phase 2 and 3** implementations
6. **Document operational procedures**
7. **Conduct disaster recovery testing**

## Compliance Considerations

The current setup lacks several compliance requirements:
- **SOC 2**: Missing logging and monitoring controls
- **ISO 27001**: Inadequate security controls
- **GDPR**: No data protection measures
- **PCI DSS**: No network segmentation (if applicable)

Implementing the recommended components will significantly improve compliance posture.
