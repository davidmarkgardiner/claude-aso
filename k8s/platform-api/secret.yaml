# DEPRECATED: This file is replaced by External Secrets
# All secrets are now managed by External Secrets and synced from Azure Key Vault
#
# To deploy secrets, use the External Secrets configuration instead:
#   kubectl apply -f deployment/external-secrets.yaml
#
# This will automatically create the platform-api-secrets secret
# with values from Azure Key Vault.
