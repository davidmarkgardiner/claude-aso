Create the managed identity and the federated on the actual target cluster. This way the config mac can be passed to the application at build time. So we can pick up the client IDs etc. for the service accounts. So that we can do it. 
Unless we use some of Shula's logic to have a job that goes and gets the client ID at build time. 

We want to spin up a cluster as a service through agile workflows. 

Also, just sem ver to the solution. 

Do we need a managed entity for Server Manager? 

How can we integrate that with the platform API?
